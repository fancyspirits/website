description: "<p>I’m mostly producing Drum & Bass as it is my favorite genre, but I also love to produce and explore music in other genres.</p>

<p>I would describe my music as wildly electrifying. I’m always chasing to create something new, something that people might never dream of.</p>

<p>I’m a music producer who loves to experiment with music. I think the best music can only be achieved by playing around and having fun, (making me personally feel joy).</p>

<p>The most important aspect of my music is the happy accidents, which it needs a lot of, but that is what makes it unique.</p>

<p>Fun Fact: I seem to be very good at producing music completely drunk lol</p>"
