description: "<p>I love making music in all genres, but the one I keep coming back to is Drum & Bass. Whether I'm DJing or producing, I explore every subgenre — from dancefloor to minimal, neurofunk, and beyond. I always aim to push boundaries and create something fresh.</p></br><p>I thrive on creativity, especially when I’m making something that feels like it hasn’t been done before. That’s when I truly fall in love with a new track I’ve just discovered.</p>"
