description: "<p>The main genres of music I create are Jungle, Liquid DnB, Neurofunk, Nu-Disco, House, Ambient, Techno and Trance.</p>

<p>I often put emphasis on being experimental and throw weird things together. The way I produce Jungle is heavily inspired by 90-2000s Intelligent Jungle and artists like Photek and Makoto. I really liked the old sound of Jungle.</p>

<p>I didn't really think much about what lunanescence meant, but I've often thought of it as the essence of the moon.</p>

<p>Fun Fact: People often refer to my music as \"PS1 music\" or some kind of racing game music, others drive fast to some songs</p>"
